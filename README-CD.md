## Project 5 - CD
Name: Logan Scarberry
### Part 1 - Semantic Versioning 
- CD Project Overview
    - The purpose of this project is to continue what I've learned in Project 4 about `docker`, `webhook`, `apache2`, and `git`. The goal is to create an `EC2` instance with `AWS` that will serve as a server for `webhook`. Then, that server will act as a listener and be used to update my website. This means I'll be able to update my website from my own local machine by simply pushing to a repository and then having my server listen to that repository for updates.
